Hi! I am the narrator. I will guide you from now on.

Do you this to be a game?
-Yes: Alright, let's play!
-No: A free thinker.
-I do not know. True, let's not rush any answer.

Do you want to lose the game?
-Yes: Game over screen.
-No: that's more reasonable
-I don't know: We'll come back to it.


This is the box. It is not any box.

This box contains the answer to any question. 

Before you decide if you open the box, 
please meet some characters:

Hi! I am Toni. I opened the box and I know the answer!

Hi! I am Wuthrer. I will not open the box, because I don't need the answer.

Hi! I am Caro and I don't know if I will open the box.

Do you want to open the box?
Yes:
Wuthrer: Are you sure that you want to reveal the answer to anything?
Toni: Let them come to me! 
Wuthrer: Not knowing the answer is what makes life meaningful.
Caro: But is it though?
Caro: You and I simply don't know what life is with the answer.
Toni: While I know what life is with the answer, but I will not spoil it to you both.
Toni: It is choice that you have to make, not I.

No: Wuthrer screen: Yes! 
Toni: Come on! Open it! 
Wuthrer: Only weak minds do need to know the answer.
Toni: It is not a question of need, but a question of why.
Toni: Any why question has an answer. this answer.
Wuthrer: But it's the quest that is important, not the actual answer.
Wuthrer: Not taking a shortcut. It's an endless fight not to look in the box.
Caro: And I don't know how long I will keep on fighting, before I finally decide to open the box.


I don't know:
Caro: Right, one should not have to make the decision.
Wuthrer: There is no in between. You either open the box or you don't!
Toni: You are just jealous, because one day or another, she will open the box.
Toni: She will left your camp and come to mine.
Toni: This is the natural way of the universe. From ignorance to knowledge.
Toni: From you to me!
